# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System

### Overview
This project is a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** built using machine learning to identify and classify various types of network traffic, including potential security threats. The system leverages a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on network traffic data to detect anomalies and attacks, ensuring robust and efficient monitoring of network security.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis**: Detect potential threats in live network traffic.
- **Interactive Web Application**: A sleek and intuitive user interface built using **Streamlit**.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can input network traffic parameters and get instant classification results.
- **Visual Results**: Displays the type of traffic detected (e.g., Legitimate, DDoS, Protocol Exploitation) with appropriate action recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the backend logic.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Machine learning algorithm for intrusion detection.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web interface.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For visualizations during model analysis.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains several network traffic parameters, such as:
- Port Number
- Received Packets
- Sent Packets
- Active Flow Entries
- Packets Looked Up
- Packets Matched

This dataset was preprocessed to remove null values, normalize features, and balance the classes for better training.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
The system uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, a robust and reliable ensemble learning method, trained on the preprocessed dataset. The model achieved high accuracy in detecting network intrusions, distinguishing between legitimate traffic and various attack types such as:
- **DDoS Attacks**
- **Protocol Exploitation**
- **Reconnaissance**
- **Traffic Manipulation**
- **Buffer Overflow**
